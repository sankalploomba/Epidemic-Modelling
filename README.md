# Epidemic-Modelling
As part of my special assignment for my Undergraduate Degree in Bachelor of Science (Honors) Computer Science, I was tasked with making a model for the spread of disease in an Epidemic. 

Since, this assignment coincided with the COVID-19 Pandemic period, I chose to make the model from human perspective as to how an infection spreads. I chose to do that beacause I believed at the time, that that could help us predict our situation during the COVID-19 Pandemic and help us identify our shortcomings in dealing with the Pandemic. 

Studying and Understanding this model can help us to be better prepared for future Epidemics/Pandemics as well.
